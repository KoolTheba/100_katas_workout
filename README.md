1. Check the katas I solved in the folder named after their level at Codewars (Level 7, 6...). Have a look into their new `readme.md` for easy navigation:

- Check [katas level 7 readme](https://github.com/KoolTheba/100_katas_workout/blob/main/katas_level7/README.md)
- Check [katas level 6 readme](https://github.com/KoolTheba/100_katas_workout/blob/main/katas_level6/README.md)

2. Check the hashtags. Represents the kind of topic that you're going to train. They are clasified as in Codewars
3. Sign up in Codewars if haven't done it already 👩‍🎤
4. You can copy the katas' links and paste it in your fav browser, press the train botton and solved it like a boss 🚀
5. Think about it as a daily/weekly/frequent-as-U-want chanllenge and keep it up!

## Why do I need to train with katas?
From my experience, it's one of the best things you can spend your time on, no matter your programming level.

Solving quick programming problems helps delving into your favorite programming language and get to know its artifacts, and build your knowledge foundations! It's also a great approach to algorithms.

But, you know, it's just my short experience as a SWE and mentor! What you do, it's eventually up 2U! 🤓

## Important! 👇
