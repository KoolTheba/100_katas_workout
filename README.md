## Why do I need to train with katas?
From my experience, it's one of the best things you can spend your time on, no matter your programming level.

Solving quick programming problems helps delving into your favorite programming language and get to know its artifacts, and build your knowledge foundations! It's also a great approach to algorithms.

But, you know, it's just my experience as a SWE and mentor! What you do, it's eventually up 2U! 🤓
